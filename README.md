# R 3MA Cross Indicator

This code represents the R 3MA Cross Indicator, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to generate buy and sell alerts based on the crossover of moving averages. The indicator uses three moving averages: fast, medium, and slow. 

## How It Works

The code consists of several functions:

### `GenerateBuyAlert()`
This function checks if the faster moving average crosses both the medium and slower moving averages upwards. If the condition is met, a green-colored R 3MA Cross arrow is displayed on the chart as a buy signal. The function also contains code to execute a buy trade. 

### `GenerateSellAlert()`
This function checks if the faster moving average crosses both the medium and slower moving averages downwards. If the condition is met, a red-colored R 3MA Cross arrow is displayed on the chart as a sell signal. The function also contains code to execute a sell trade. 

### `DisplayGreenArrow()`
This function is responsible for displaying a green arrow on the chart. 

### `DisplayRedArrow()`
This function is responsible for displaying a red arrow on the chart. 

### `OnTick()`
This is the main function that is executed on each tick of the market. It calculates the moving averages by calling the respective functions (`CalculateFastMA()`, `CalculateMediumMA()`, and `CalculateSlowMA()`). It then generates buy and sell alerts based on the crossover of the moving averages by calling `GenerateBuyAlert()` and `GenerateSellAlert()`.

### `CalculateFastMA()`, `CalculateMediumMA()`, and `CalculateSlowMA()`
These functions calculate the fast, medium, and slow moving averages respectively. The code for calculating these moving averages is not provided and should be added separately.
